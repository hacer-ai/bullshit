## What is this?

A **frontier-grade, post-AGI, Mamba-powered** phrase generation system capable of producing enterprise-ready AI terminology at sub-second latency. Each output is semantically aligned with current VC sentiment and has been RLHF-tuned against 847 YCombinator pitch decks.

Do not let the simplicity fool you. This is not a website. This is **infrastructure**.

---

## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| RAM | 512 GB DDR6 ECC | 1 TB (for the vocabulary) |
| GPU | NVIDIA Blackwell B200 (×8) | GB300 NVL72 rack |
| CPU | 256-core ARM or better | Quantum co-processor required |
| Storage | 40 PB NVMe | Bring your own data center |
| Internet | 100 Gbps symmetric | Direct IX peering preferred |
| Cooling | Liquid nitrogen loop | Geothermal recommended |
| Power | 3-phase industrial | Your own substation |

> **Note:** Running this on anything less than a dedicated Blackwell cluster will result in undefined behavior, existential dread, and vocabulary that is only *mostly* correct.

---

## OpenClaw Compatibility

**OpenClaw users:** This application requires a **dedicated RTX 5090** or newer Blackwell-family GPU to access. Attempting to run on a 4090 will produce an output that is technically words but spiritually incorrect.

If you are on a Mac: we are so sorry.

## Installation

```bash
# Step 1: Provision your Kubernetes cluster (minimum 400 nodes)
kubectl apply -f ./manifests/bullshit-operator.yaml

# Step 2: Initialize the Polymarket CLI integration
polymarket auth --wallet ./wallets/your-life-savings.json

# Step 3: Connect to your bank account for real-world alpha generation
bullshit-cli connect --bank "all of them" --mode aggressive

# Step 4: Open index.html
open index.html
```

## Polymarket & Financial Integration

The generator ships with a **native Polymarket CLI bridge** that:

- Automatically opens positions on the likelihood that your generated phrase will appear in a Series B deck within 90 days
- Connects to your brokerage, crypto exchange, and any wallets you may have forgotten about
- Routes profits through a **RLHF-optimized yield strategy** (results not guaranteed, SEC not notified)
- Accepts payment in ETH, SOL, AVAX, any layer-2 of your choosing, and vibes

> Past performance is not indicative of future returns. Future returns are not indicative of anything. This is not financial advice. This is not medical advice. This is barely software.

---

## Crypto Bro Features

- **Onchain provenance** — every generated phrase is hashed and stored on a chain (TBD which one)
- **Phrase NFTs** — mint your output as a 1-of-1 (gas fees are your problem)
- **Token-gated vocabulary** — hold 10,000 $BSHT to unlock the premium adjective tier
- **DAO governance** — vote on which words get added next quarter
- **Staking rewards** — stake your favorite phrases to earn yield in the form of more phrases
- **DePIN integration** — your CPU cycles contribute to the Decentralized Bullshit Network

```

This system was architected by a team of **quantum coders** operating out of a distributed co-working space across 14 time zones. The core algorithm was derived from first principles using a technique we call *Stochastic Vocabulary Emergence* (SVE), which is a real term we just coined.

---

## Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Phrases per second | 1 (you have to click) |
| Token efficiency | ∞ (zero LLM API calls) |
| Carbon footprint | Negligible (the data center was already on) |
| VC fundability of output | 94th percentile |
| Times the word "agentic" appears | Statistically inevitable |

## Roadmap

- [x] Generate bullshit
- [ ] Make bullshit agentic
- [ ] Give bullshit its own bullshit generator
- [ ] IPO
- [ ] Use IPO proceeds to build better bullshit generator
- [ ] Acquire OpenAI
- [ ] Retire

## In Memory

This project stands on the shoulders of giants. Specifically, the Original and GOAT:

**[The Corporate Bullshit Generator](https://www.dack.com/web/bullshit.html)** by Dack Ragus (c. 2000)

He was doing this before "agentic" was a word. Probably before some of our contributors were born. Respect.
